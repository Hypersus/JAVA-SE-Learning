| Hot Key        | Function                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl + D       | Delete a line                                |
| Ctrl + Alt + ↓ | Copy the line and paste it downwards         |
| Ctrl + Alt + ↑ | Copy the line and paste it upwards           |
| Ctrl + Alt + V | Assign the new class to a reference variable |

NOTE: Afterwards I found that it's actually Eclipse Hot Key. You can change the hotkey template at File-->Setting-->Keymap
